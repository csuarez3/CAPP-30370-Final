Carina Suarez's Final Project
=============================

Purpose and Goals
-----------------

###Main Page

This page serves as a homepage.  It links to the "About Me," "Fall 2013 Work," and "Resume" pages that contain the bulk of the information.

It is responsive.  At screen width 950px, each box is on a continuously looping CSS animation running through five colors.  At widths 700px and 500px, the boxes do not have the CSS animation because it would not run well on tablets.  At every screen width, the box will lighten on mouseover (hover).

###About Me

This page has general information about me.  It'll be a typical about me page, not too specific because I also have a resume page.

###Fall 2013 Work

This page contains all the assignments I have completed in the Fall 2013 semester at the University of Notre Dame thus far.

###Resume

This page is an online, organized version of my resume.  Each part of the resume will be on a different tab, much like in Web Design Project 18.
