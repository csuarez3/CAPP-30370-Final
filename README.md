Carina Suarez's Final Project
=============================

Purpose and Goals
-----------------

###Main Page

This page serves as a homepage.  It links to the "About Me," "Fall 2013 Work," and "Resume" pages that contain the bulk of the information.

It is responsive.  At screen width 950px, each box is on a continuously looping CSS animation running through five colors.  At widths 700px and 500px, the boxes do not have the CSS animation because it would not run well on tablets.  At every screen width, the box will lighten on mouseover (hover).

###About Me
