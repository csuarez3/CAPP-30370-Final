Carina Suarez's Final Project
=============================

Purpose and Goals
-----------------

###Main Page

This page serves as a homepage.  It links to the "About Me," "Fall 2013 Work," and "Resume" pages that contain the bulk of the information.

It is responsive.  At screen width 950px, each box is on a continuously looping CSS animation running through five colors.  At widths 700px and 500px, the boxes do not have the CSS animation because it would not run well on tablets.  At every screen width, the box will lighten on mouseover (hover).

###About Me

This page should have general information about me.  It'll be a typical about me page, not too specific because I also have a resume page.  In reality, however, it is just lorem ipsum because I did not have time to actually write an About Me.  Instead, I have been matching over 40 poems to their authors and years only to realize that I could not actually match them to themselves.  Enjoy my agony and frustration with my poetry final, much akin to that of waiting for the next season of Sherlock (just one more month!)

###Fall 2013 Work

This page contains all the assignments I have completed in the Fall 2013 semester at the University of Notre Dame thus far.

###Resume

This page is an online, organized version of my resume.  Each part of the resume will be on a different tab, much like in Web Design Project 18.
